# ML_webApp_SalaryPrediction

This is a ML webapp which predicts the salary of a software developer with the help of the StackOverflow data.

This uses Random Forest Regression algorithm along with GridSearchCV to choose the best fitting model.

I've used Streamlit for creating a python app.

It basically uses numpy, pandas, and matplotlib for visulising the data
